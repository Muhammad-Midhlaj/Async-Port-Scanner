This is an asynchronous Python script that performs a port scan on a given URL using the httpx library and the asyncio module. The script creates an HTTP client and iterates over a range of port numbers from 0 to 65535 (inclusive). For each port, the script attempts to establish a connection to the URL by making a GET request. If the request is successful (i.e., the server responds with a status code of 200), the script prints a message indicating that the port "WORKS!". If an exception is raised (e.g., if the server does not respond or the connection is refused), the script simply passes and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. The script also prints a message whenever it reaches a new hundredth port (e.g., port 100, port 200, etc.). This can be useful for tracking the progress of the port scan. The script is designed to be run asynchronously, allowing it to perform tasks concurrently and potentially improve its performance.
